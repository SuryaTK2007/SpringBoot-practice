What are Daemons? 
The Gradle Daemon is a background process that makes your future builds much faster. Think of it like keeping a car engine warm on a cold day. 
The first time you start it (./gradlew bootRun), Gradle kicks off this daemon process. The next time you run a command, the daemon is already 
warm and waiting, so your project builds and runs much faster. It's a performance feature, so seeing it is a good thing.

JPA H2 database:
The H2 database is perfect for learning because it requires zero installation or setup. It runs inside your application and resets every time you
restart, which is great for development and testing.
